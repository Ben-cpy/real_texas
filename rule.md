| ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Preparation / Blind Setup**  | Before each round, the dealer button rotates clockwise among players. The first player to the left posts the small blind, the next posts the big blind. These are forced bets to build the pot. ([Wikipedia][1])      |
| **Dealing (Hole Cards)**       | Each player receives **2 private cards** (face down), visible only to themselves. ([Wikipedia][1])                                                                             |
| **First Betting Round: Pre-flop** | Starting from the player to the left of the big blind (usually called UTG), players act in turn: fold, call the current bet, or raise. If no one raises, players can check (bet 0) or fold.                        |
| **Flop**                       | Deal three community cards face up on the table. Before dealing, "burn" one card (discard the top card) to prevent cheating. ([PokerNews][2])                                  |
| **Second Betting Round (Post-Flop)** | Starting from the first active player to the left, players act in turn: fold, check, bet, or raise.                                                                         |
| **Turn (Fourth Street)**       | Deal one more community card. Burn one card before dealing.                                                                                                                    |
| **Third Betting Round (Post-Turn)** | Betting order is the same.                                                                                                                                                   |
| **River (Fifth Street)**       | Deal the final community card. Burn one card before dealing.                                                                                                                   |
| **Final Betting Round (Post-River)** | Last round of betting, same as before.                                                                                                                                      |
| **Showdown**                   | Remaining players reveal their cards and compare the best five-card hand. Rules:                                                                                                |
|   └ Hand Comparison Rules      | - Players can use 0, 1, or 2 of their own hole cards plus community cards to make the best 5-card hand. ([Wikipedia][1])<br>- If multiple players have the same hand, use the "kicker" to break ties. If completely identical, split the pot. ([Texas Ag Agents Association][3])<br>- If only one player remains after a betting round, no showdown is needed; that player wins the pot. ([PokerNews][2]) |
| **Settlement / Pot Distribution** | The winner receives all chips in the pot or their share. If there are ties, split the pot; any remainder goes to the first player after the dealer button clockwise. ([Wikipedia][1])                                |
