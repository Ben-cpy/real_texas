## 🎯 Detailed Comparison Rules

### 1. Royal Flush
- Only one combination: A-K-Q-J-10 of the same suit
- If multiple players have a Royal Flush, the pot is split

### 2. Straight Flush
- Compared by the highest card
- A-2-3-4-5 is the lowest straight flush (wheel)
- K-Q-J-10-9 is the second-highest straight flush

### 3. Four of a Kind
- Compare the four cards of the same rank first
- If the four of a kind is the same, compare the kicker (single card)

### 4. Full House
- Compare the three of a kind first
- If the three of a kind is the same, compare the pair

### 5. Flush
- Compare card by card starting from the highest
- If the highest cards are equal, compare the second highest, and so on

### 6. Straight
- Compared by the highest card
- A can be used as 1: A-2-3-4-5
- A cannot wrap around: Q-K-A-2-3 is not a straight

### 7. Three of a Kind
- Compare the three cards of the same rank first
- If the three of a kind is the same, compare the remaining two single cards from highest to lowest

### 8. Two Pairs
- Compare the higher pair first
- If the higher pairs are equal, compare the lower pair
- If both pairs are equal, compare the remaining single card

### 9. One Pair
- Compare the pair first
- If the pairs are equal, compare the remaining three single cards from highest to lowest

### 10. High Card
- Compare card by card starting from the highest
- If all five cards are identical, the pot is split

## 💡 Practical Tips

### Memory Techniques
1. **Sequential Memory**: Royal → Straight Flush → Four of a Kind → Full House → Flush → Straight → Three of a Kind → Two Pairs → One Pair → High Card
2. **Probability Memory**: The harder the hand is to make, the stronger it is
3. **Practical Memory**: Only One Pair or better is considered "having a hand"; High Card and One Pair are more common

### Common Misconceptions
1. **Suit Ranking**: Suits have no ranking hierarchy in Texas Hold'em
2. **Straight Mistakes**: A-2-3-4-5 is the lowest straight, not A-K-Q-J-10
3. **Ignoring Kickers**: When hands are the same type, kickers (remaining cards) must be compared
4. **Split Pot Conditions**: Only completely identical 5-card hands result in a split pot
