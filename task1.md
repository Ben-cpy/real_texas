1. Display the current round in the bottom-left corner of the interface to avoid covering the table area.
2. The order of each round is still incorrect. Update the logic to ensure that, even with a new AI player whose position index increases, the action order strictly follows clockwise or counterclockwise as in a real game.
3. The card back for AI players is not visually appealing. Find and use a better card back design.
4. The front of the cards (all cards in play) should have a white background instead of the current color.
5. For card suits, spades and clubs should be black, while hearts and diamonds should be a more vivid red.
6. Make the 'checked' status more prominent during gameplay; currently, it is only shown in gray.
